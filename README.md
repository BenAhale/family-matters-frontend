## R1: Description of your website

**Purpose**

With each new generation becoming more and more tech savvy and being familiar with using phones/computers, there is a need for new and improved platforms to cater to these families. This platform is designed for families to be able to more efficiently manage their day to day lives. Gone are the days of manually writing entries or events in diaries or on a physical calendar. 'Family Matters' provides families with a way to track everything in one simple application. Families can log events in a virtual calendar, upload and store their treasured memories via family photos and videos, or even manage grocery shopping and chores lists for children.

**Functionality/Features**

- User Authentication, to ensure only verified users can login or sign up to a new family
- Fully functioning calendar, that members can add events to
- Google Calendar API, to send email notifications of upcoming events (OPTIONAL, based on time)
- Image Upload, for users to add photos to the family album
- Multiple animations (CSS) and events (JS) to make the app seem more inviting and stimulating
- Editable grocery list, that family members can add to, edit and delete
- Chore management system, to see what needs to be done for the week (OPTIONAL, based on time)

**Target Audience**

On a professional standpoint, there has been a demand for Family apps over the last few years. This app is designed to meet those needs for families that are after a better way of managing things around the house. Whether it be appointments, children's chores, grocery lists, family photos and more. The way the app will be designed will allow for edits and tweaks that can enable it to be built into other variations to meet the needs of the client.

On a personal standpoint the target audience is for future employers to see what we can do as junior full stack developers. Demonstrating what we are capable of and what our time at Coder Academy has taught us will prove that we are ready to join the workforce.
